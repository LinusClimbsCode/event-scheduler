WBS Coding School Project (Lesson 54 Topic 1) Event Scheduler 

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Guidelines and Requirements

This project is designed to enhance your skills in React by building an application that interacts with real data via a RESTful API. Until now, we‚Äôve only stored data in the browser using localStorage or relied on existing data from APIs like the Pokemon API or the Movie DB. However, in a real application, we will need to persist some data, which will ultimately live inside a database. For now, it should suffice to know that some APIs expose endpoints or methods to create, read, update, or delete data, collectively known as CRUD. These actions map to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP request methods!

## ‚åõ Duration: 5 days (Full Time) / 10 Days (Part Time)
## üìà Presentation: TBD by Instructor | Mandatory

| ID    | Functional Requirement           | Description                                                                                                                           |
|-------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001 | Public GitHub Repository         | Store all code in a single public repo; do not add instructors as collaborators.                                                      |
| FR002 | Incremental Development with PRs | Merge every change into main via Pull Requests.                                                                                       |
| FR003 | Setup a New React Application    | Build a new React application from scratch using Vite.                                                                                |
| FR004 | Habit Creation                   | Allow users to create new habits with custom names and set target goals for completion frequency. (e.g., drink water 8 times per day) |
| FR005 | Habit Progress Counter           | Implement increment/decrement counter for each habit to track daily progress.                                                         |
| FR006 | Total Progress Tracking          | Display overall progress across all habits, showing the completed habits and total habits for the day.                                |
| FR007 | Completion Tracking              | Mark habits as complete by conditionally changing the style when the counter equals the set goal.                                     |
| FR008 | State Management                 | Implement proper React state management using hooks for habits and goals                                                              |
| FR009 | Local Storage Integration        | Persist habit data using browser‚Äôs local storage.                                                                                     |
| FR010 | Responsive Design                | Ensure the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.                                                                 |

‚ö†Ô∏è API: [Head over to this repo](https://github.com/WebDev-WBSCodingSchool/events-api), follow the instructions for installing and running the app. You should have a working API running on your computer. The API is fully documented and you can even try some endpoints in the live documentation powered by [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/). You‚Äôll eventually learn how to create your very own RESTful APIs in the meantime, we got this.

## ‚úã HOLD UP!
Before you even think of opening VS Code to set up your project, take a moment to plan your application:

Create a mock on Figma, MS Paint, or paper! The application is simple enough, but you can make it as pretty and cool as you want!
Plan your routes ahead of time so you can structure your application accordingly.
Break your UI into components the way you did in the past
Distribute the tasks and load

## ü§ì Tips for Effective Planning
- **Daily stand-ups:** Use them to keep your instructor in the loop about blockers and to share insights with your classmates.
- **Keep things tidy and in order:** You won‚Äôt find a Trello board here, but you can create one on your own!
- **ASK FOR HELP:** If you‚Äôre stuck for more than 30 minutes, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for assistance!

## Conclusion
This project will enhance your skills with hands-on experience in working with React, managing localStorage, interacting with APIs, and creating interactive web applications. Dive in, enjoy the process, and happy coding! üöÄ
